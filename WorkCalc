/* This program will gather a few things.
  How many minutes you worked today
  How much you made prior to today
  How many hours do you currently have scheduled
  How many days left in the pay period
  What is your paycheck goal.
  
 It'll then spit out how much you're projected to make, and how many hours you
 need to hit the goal, and other details
